    <h3>Sample Content</h3>
<p>A <b>multi-tier enterprise application</b> consists of two types of objects:
<b>application logic components</b> and <b>persistent data objects</b>. 
Application logic components represent actions and define methods that perform common
 tasks such as calculating the order price, customer credit card billing, and so on. 
 Session beans model the application logic components as they contain the logic to 
 perform the application tasks.</p>
<p>It is easy and simple to manage the business data present in large organizations as
objects rather than as relational rows in a database. Business data when treated as
objects are easy to handle and manage as they are compact in nature.</p>
<p>Entities are not associated with only EJBs and can be used in <b>Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) </b>
environment. The differences between an Entity and a Session bean are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Entities have a client-visibility and a persistent identity that is distinct from
    their object reference. Each entity is distinct from the other because of their
    identities. Clients can use identities to pass the reference of an entity to other
    applications. However, this is not possible with Session beans.</li>
    <li>Entity bean cannot be accessed remotely, whereas Session beans can be
    accessed locally as well as remotely.</li>
    <li>Entity’s lifetime is not dependent on the application’s lifetime. Entity bean
    have a much longer lifetime than a client’s session as it depends on how long
    the data is present in the database.</li>
    <li>
        Entities represent data in a storage that is permanent as well as fault-tolerant
        and hence, they are long lasting and can survive application server or
        database crash. This data can be reconstructed in the memory. Hence, it can
        be said that entity is an in-memory representation of persistent data that:
        <ul style="list-style-type: '&#9830   '; ">
                <li>Can be loaded from persistent store and its field populated with the stored data</li>
                <li>Can be modified in-memory to change the data values</li>
                <li>Can be saved and correspondingly database is updated</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
